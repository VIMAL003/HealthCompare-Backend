{{--Welcome to Hospital Compare!--}}

<p>UK healthcare system is amongst the very best in the world, with over 750 NHS plus private healthcare providers in
    England alone.</p>
<p>If you need to see a hospital consultant, <a class="btn-link" href="/">hospitalcompare.co.uk</a> is a free-to-use resource that enables you to compare
    the whole market and choose the hospital that suits you best.</p>
<p>You can find out, step-by-step, how to use the website here, or read more about your legal rights as a patient under
    the Health and Social Care Act here. For example, did you know that many private hospitals also provide NHS
    treatment? You could dive into our Frequently Asked Questions here or find out more about us here.</p>
<h3>So, how does Hospital Compare work?</h3>
<p><a class="btn-link" href="/">Hospitalcompare.co.uk</a> pulls together a host of different, complex, datasets and brings them together in a way that
    helps you work out which is the best hospital for you. You can browse the hospital list by entering your postcode
    here.</p>
<p>We also have a list of over 500 treatments, grouped by their specialty – if you already know what treatment you need,
    you can select it from the list. Don’t worry if you don’t – there are generic body areas in the list that you can
    select to filter the search results and also a not known option. Using the treatment list filters out hospitals that
    don’t provide that type of service, so you only see hospitals that provide the service you need.</p>
<h3>Our analysis</h3>
<p>Our analysis shows that there is often significant variation in both waiting times and care quality in England at a
    national, regional and county level. Patients in some areas of England are waiting many months longer for their
    hospital treatment that others elsewhere are receiving in weeks. This is relevant because you have the legal right
    to choose where you are referred for your NHS treatment (there are some exceptions, which are outlined below *).
    Many people are not aware of this right.</p>
<p>Furthermore, many people are unaware of their right to start consultant-led treatment within 18 weeks of referral, or
    to request an offer of an alternative provider that can start your treatment sooner. The NHS must take all
    reasonable steps to meet patients’ requests and <a class="btn-link" href="/">hospitalcompare.co.uk</a> is here to help put you in control.</p>
<h3>Knowledge is Power!</h3>
<p>We hope to fully empower patients to choose the best quality hospitals and shortest waiting times locally or across
    England. We believe people could be treated in some cases months earlier if they exercised these legal rights.</p>
<p>Our free-to-use site enables you to search using your postcode and over 500 treatment types to shortlist potentially
    suitable hospital choices and compare the latest reported waiting times, hospital quality rating, cancelled
    operations and user ratings. You can search by a radius of five miles right up to nationwide.</p>
<p>We also intend for the site to be available to patients in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland during 2020.</p>
